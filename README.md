# speaker-submissions [![Donate on Gittip](http://badgr.co/gittip/twolfson.png)](https://www.gittip.com/twolfson/)

A collection of submissions for "Call for Speakers" listings

Originally, I had my speaker submissions spread across various repositories on GitHub. Now, all future ones will be consolidated here.

## Viewing a submission
Each submission is placed inside of its own folder in case it has any required assets. Additionally, this is for consistency among submissions.
