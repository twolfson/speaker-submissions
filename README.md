# speaker-submissions

A collection of submissions for "Call for Speakers" listings

Originally, I had my speaker submissions spread across various repositories on GitHub. Now, all future ones will be consolidated here.

## Viewing a submission
Each submission is placed inside of its own folder in case it has any required assets. Additionally, this is for consistency among submissions.
