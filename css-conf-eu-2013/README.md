# CSS Conf EU 2013
http://2013.cssconf.eu/call-for-speakers/

## Topic of presentation *
Inverting your website colors

## Summary (to be used on site), plain text or Markdown (~3-5 sentences). *
Inverting your websites color is a practical design technique to see your website with a new set of eyes. We will walk through making our own bookmarklet that inverts the colors of our website (even down to images). This will be cross-browser, tested down to IE6, and built with modules that exist today.

## What else you want to tell us about the talk outside the public summary (~3-5 sentences)?
This talk is more JavaScript centric than CSS centric, however our worlds are tightly knit. This will be a learning experience for all about how CSS can be controlled and manipulated in a cross-browser fashion.

If you don't think this is a common scenario, consider [Chosen][chosen] which is a JavaScript plugin but relies on CSS to be on the page to appear properly; in the most practical sense, the CSS should be bundled with the JS to enforce a proper module rather than put the CSS with other CSS and JS with other JS.
