## What is the topic of your presentation? *
Evolution of Behavioral Driven Development

## Give me a short (2-3 sentences) summary of your talk presenation. *
Let's take a walk through the evolution of testing; from humble begginings in manual QA, to machine-like TDD, to human-comprehensible BDD. This includes demonstrations to get BDD novices started on the right foot.

## Why do you want to speak at Industry?
It is important to recognize the shoulders of giants we stand on; to pay homage to them and to learn from the technologies they have made. By presenting this talk, I want to spread further knowledge about BDD, its applications, and its history.
