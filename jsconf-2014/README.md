## It would be amazing to see this speaker present on the topic of: *
> Can be general or specific, this will only be shared with the curation committee.

Developing faster, a showcase of tools to help reduce the tedium of creating, maintaining, and publishing repositories.

Each time you create a new repository, it seems like a mountain of unnecessary and unwanted work. Most of the time, common commands/actions can be combined or removed entirely. One example of this is publication which can include as many steps as:

- `git tag`
- Updating `package.json`
- Pushing tags
- Publishing to `npm`
- Updating `bower.json`
- Updating `component.json`

and they must be run in a specific order, which is not the one above ;)
