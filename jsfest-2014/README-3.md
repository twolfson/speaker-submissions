## Title
GIFSockets

## Description
For Node Knockout 2013, I implemented GIFSockets in exclusively JavaScript. The following week, I make it re-usable open source modules.

There was a tweet by Nuno Job expressing interest about GIFSockets being shown at DHTMLConf

The talk would probably consist of the architecture of GIFSockets but we can go any direction with it.
