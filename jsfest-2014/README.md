## Title
Develop faster

## Description
This talk will walk through removing the tedium from creating, maintaining, and publishing a repository. It showcases tools that either combine multiple actions and remove the need to leave the command line.

A good example is publication. One possible flow is:

- `git tag`
- Updating `package.json`
- Pushing tags
- Publishing to `npm`
- Updating `bower.json`
- Updating `component.json`

*and* these must be run in a specific order!
