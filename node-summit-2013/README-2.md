## Proposed talk outline/details (400 Words MAX) *
The creation and publication of repositories can seem like a tedious process when working on a large project. However, it should not be. We will go over practical tools to streamline the creation of repositories on GitHub and manage versions for/publish to `npm`, `bower`, `component.io` in 1 step or less.

For development, we will cover tightening the feedback loop and getting instantaneous results as you iterate.

## Why will this presentation be important to the Node.js community and the Node Summit Conference? (100 Words MAX) *
Node.js thrives on its ecosystem. However, creating and maintaining small modules rather than a large project can seem overwhelming. This talk will make the smaller scenario seem more approachable.

Discovery of a bunch of new tools and applying old techniques (e.g. live coding) to unexpected areas.
