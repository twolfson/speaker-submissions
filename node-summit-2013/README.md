## Proposed Name of the NodeTalk *
Evolution of Behavioral Driven Development

## Intended Audience (assumed level of technical expertise)
Intermediate

## Proposed talk abstract (100 Words MAX) *
We will walk through the past, present, and future of BDD. This includes demonstrations to get BDD novices started on the right foot.

## Proposed talk outline/details (400 Words MAX) *
We will start with an example of BDD, using `mocha`, to give those who have never experienced BDD, a taste of it.

Then, we will go through common misconceptions (e.g. what separates TDD from BDD).

Next, we walk through the the birth of TDD, the evolution into BDD, and review the landscape at large.

We will finish with my own personal experiment in the BDD space which is a split loose specification / implementation framework called `doubleshot`.

## Why will this presentation be important to the Node.js community and the Node Summit Conference? (100 Words MAX) *
We are fortunate to have the amount of modules related to testing we do. However, it is easy to lose track of how things came to be. I think this will reinforce the importance of acknowledging our past.

## What do you think the key highlights and takeaways will be from your NodeTalk? (100 Words MAX) *
The key highlights will be the history of BDD, getting a distilled understanding of what BDD is, and how to use it.
